disthene: cassandra backed metric storage *writer*
==================================================

This project is inspired by [cyanite](https://github.com/pyr/cyanite) and is intended to replace it in write mode only. 
It must be fully compatible with **cyanite** and cyanite can still be used for reading. I've started another project 
which will do the reads. And, yes, I'm convinced that in a large scale setup (and that's why I started **disthene** project) it's best to separate these two roles. 

## Motivation

There are a couple of things which seem to be an absolute must and which were missing in **cyanite**:

* aggregation: ability to sum similar metrics from several servers
* blacklisting: ability to omit storing metrics which match a certain pattern. Makes not much sense by itself but is quite handy when you have previous item
* caching incoming paths: this may really reduce the load on Elasticsearch cluster
* some minimal set of own metrics (received count, write count, etc)
* true multitenancy

The other thing is performance. **Disthene** is being developed with one major requirement in mind - performance. 
Essentially, in most cases the only bottleneck will be C\*. 
There is no ultimate benchmark here (mostly because of the C\* bottleneck in test lab) 
but it looks like something like 1M data points/core/minute should not be a problem     

## Compiling 

This is a standard Java Maven project. 

```
mvn package
```

will most probably do the trick.

## Running

First of all, it's strongly recommended to run it with Java 8. Even though this software is fully compatible with Java 7. 
The main reason for that is a bug in Java ([JDK-7032154](http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=7032154)) prior to version 8
 
There are a couple of things you will need in runtime, just the same set as for **cyanite**

* Cassandra
* Elasticsearch

Cassandra schema is identical to that of **cyanite**:

```
CREATE TABLE metric (
  period int,
  rollup int,
  tenant text,
  path text,
  time bigint,
  data list<double>,
  PRIMARY KEY ((tenant, period, rollup, path), time)
) WITH
  bloom_filter_fp_chance=0.010000 AND
  caching='KEYS_ONLY' AND
  comment='' AND
  dclocal_read_repair_chance=0.000000 AND
  gc_grace_seconds=864000 AND
  index_interval=128 AND
  read_repair_chance=0.100000 AND
  replicate_on_write='true' AND
  populate_io_cache_on_flush='false' AND
  default_time_to_live=0 AND
  speculative_retry='NONE' AND
  memtable_flush_period_in_ms=0 AND
  compaction={'class': 'SizeTieredCompactionStrategy'} AND
  compression={'sstable_compression': 'LZ4Compressor'};

```
## Configuration

TBD

## Thanks

Thanks go to Pierre-Yves Ritschard [https://github.com/pyr](https://github.com/pyr), Bruno Reni√© ([https://github.com/brutasse](https://github.com/brutasse)) - 
this project is useless without their work on **cyanite**, **graphite-api**, **graphite-cyanite**
